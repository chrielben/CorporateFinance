knitr::include_graphics("figures/matrix.jpg")
```

a. *Which countries would be profitable to the firm? Which of the five is the most profitable?* [@book, p.338]

b. *If current budgeting can support €100 million expenditure in year 0, what combination of regions is optimal?* [@book, p.338]

c. *Assume now that you can expand without regional saturation. With the budget constraint in part b, which region is optimal?* [@book, p.338]

### Exercise 10.2

*Consider the purchase of a new milling machine. What purchase price makes the NPV of the project zero? Base your analysis on the following facts.* [@book, p.338]

a. *Determine zero-coupon rates for years 1-5 to the nearest 0.01 per cent.* [@book, p.339]

```

*Consider the cash flows associated with undertaking Project X.* [@book, p.339]

a. *Is this an early or later cash flow stream?* [@book, p.339]

b. *Based on the term structure of interest rates in exercise 10.5, what is the hurdle rate? What does such a hurdle rate represent?* [@book, p.339]

c. *Calculate the IRR for Project X.* [@book, p.339]

d. *Based on the hurdle rate calculated and a comparison with the IRR, should you undertake the project?* [@book, p.339]

e. *If the sign of each cash flow were reversed, how would the hurdle rate and project IRR change? How would your decision change? Why?* [@book, p.339]

### Exercise 10.7

*As a regional managing director of Finco, an Italy-based investment company, your mandate is to scour Europe in search of promising investment opportunities, and to recommend one project to corporate headquarters in Milan. Your analysts have screened thousands of propective ventures, and have passed on the following four projects for your final review:* [@book, p.339]

### Exercise 10.8

*ABC Metalworks wants to determine which model sheetcutter to purchase. Three choices are available: machine 1 costs the least, but must be replaced the most frequently; machine 2 has average cost and average lifespan; machine 3 costs the most, but needs only infrequent replacement. Assume that all three machines meet production quality and volume standards; that annual maintenance is inversely proportional to the purchase price (that is, the cheaper machine requires higher maintenance); and that machine replacement, being instantaneous, will not disrupt production.* [@book, p.340]

### Exercise 10.9

*Investco, a South African research company, must decide on the level of computer technology it will buy for its analysis department. Package A, a mid-level technology, would cost R15 million for firmwide installation, whereas package B, a high-level technology, would cost R21 million Equipped with level A technology, the firm could generate a cash flow of R9 million for two years before the technology would require replacement; with level B technology, the firm could generate a cash flow of R10.2 million for three years, after which the technology would require replacement. Investco is interested in a six-year planning horizon. Assume the following about discount rates:* [@book, p.340]

## Exercises Appendix 10A

### Exercise 10A.1
