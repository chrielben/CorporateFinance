### Exercise 11.1

*A project has an expected cash flow of €1 million one year from now. The standard deviation of this cash flow is €250,000. If the expected return of the market portfolio is 10 per cent, the risk-free rate is 5 per cent, the standard deviation of the market is 0.5, what is the present value of the cash flow? Assume the CAPM holds. (Hint: Use the certainty equivalent method.)* [@book, p.389]

*In a two-factor APT model, easyJet has a factor beta of 1.15 on the first factor portfolio, which is highly correlated with the change in GDP, and a factor beta of -0.3 on the second factor portfolio, which is highly correlated with interest rate changes.

### Exercise 11.16

*Risk-free rates at horizons of one year, two years and three years are 6.00 per cent per year, 6.25 per cent per year and 6.75 per cent per year, respectively.

Value each of these cash flows seperately.* [@book, p.390]
