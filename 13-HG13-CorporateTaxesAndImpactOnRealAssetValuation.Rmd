### Exercise 13.1

*Exercises 13.1 - 13.7 make use of the following data.* [@book, p.458]

*In 1985, General Motors (GM) was evaluating the acquisition of Hughes Aitcraft Corporation. Recognizing that the appropriate WACC for discounting the projected cash flows for Hughes was different from General Motors' WACC, GM assumed that Hughes was of approximately the same risk as Lockheed or Northrop, which had low-risk defence contracts and products that were similar to those of Hughes. Specifically, assume the Hamada model of debt interest tax shields and the inputs in the table.* [@book, p.458]

*Analyse the Hughes acquisition by first computing the betas of the comparison firms, Lockheed and Northrop, as if they were all equity financed. (Hint: use equation (13.7) to obtain $\beta_{UA}$ from $\beta_E$.)* [@book, p.459]

### Exercise 13.2

*Exercises 13.1 - 13.7 make use of the following data.* [@book, p.458]

*In 1985, General Motors (GM) was evaluating the acquisition of Hughes Aitcraft Corporation. Recognizing that the appropriate WACC for discounting the projected cash flows for Hughes was different from General Motors' WACC, GM assumed that Hughes was of approximately the same risk as Lockheed or Northrop, which had low-risk defence contracts and products that were similar to those of Hughes. Specifically, assume the Hamada model of debt interest tax shields and the inputs in the table.* [@book, p.458]

*Compute $\beta_{UA}$, the beta of the unlevered assets of the Hughes acquisition, by taking the average of the betas of the unlevered assets of Lockheed and Northrop.* [@book, p.459]

*Compute the value of Hughes if the WACC of GM at its existing leverage ratio is used instead of the WACC computed from the comparison firms (see exercise 13.4).* [@book, p.459]

### Exercise 13.7

*Exercises 13.1 - 13.7 make use of the following data.* [@book, p.458]

*In 1985, General Motors (GM) was evaluating the acquisition of Hughes Aitcraft Corporation. Recognizing that the appropriate WACC for discounting the projected cash flows for Hughes was different from General Motors' WACC, GM assumed that Hughes was of approximately the same risk as Lockheed or Northrop, which had low-risk defence contracts and products that were similar to those of Hughes. Specifically, assume the Hamada model of debt interest tax shields and the inputs in the table.* [@book, p.458]

*Apply the APV method. First, compute the value of the unlevered assets of the Hughes acquisition. Next, compute the present value of the tax shield. Finally, add the two numbers.* [@book, p.459]

### Exercise 13.8

*Compute the WACC of BA Cityflyer in Example 13.15 by doing the following.* [@book, p.459]

a. *Compute the $\beta_E$, of BA Cityflyer using equation (13.6).* [@book, p.459]

b. *Apply the CAPM's risk-expected return equation to obtain BA Cityflyer's $\bar{r}_E$, assuming a risk-free rate of 6 per cent and a market risk premium of 8.4 per cent.* [@book, p.459]

c. *Estimate the WACC, using equation (13.8).* [@book, p.459]

d. *Compare this WACC with the WACC in Example 13.15. If they are not the same, you have made a mistake.* [@book, p.459]

### Exercise 13.9

*GT Associates have plans to strat a widget company financed with 60 per cent debt and 40 per cent equity. Other widget companies are financed with 25 per cent debt and 75 per cent equity, and have equity betas of 1.5. GT's borrowing costs will be 14 per cent, the risk-free rate is 6 per cent, and the expected rate of return on the market is 10 per cent. The tax rate is 28 per cent. Compute the equity beta and WACC for GT Associates.* [@book, p.459]

### Exercise 13.10

*The HTT Company is considering a new product. The new product has a five-year life. Sales and net income after taxes for the new product are estimated in the following table.* [@book, p.459]

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = "150px",}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/matrix.jpg")
```

*The equipment to produce the new product costs €500,000. The €500,000 would be borrowed at a risk-free interest rate of 5 per cent. However, the $\bar{r}_E$ machine adds only €300,000 to the firm's debt capacity in years 1, 2 and 3, and only €200,000 in years 4 and 5.* [@book, p.460]

*Although net income includes the depreciation deduction, it does not include the interest deduction (that is, it assumes that the equipment is financed with equity). The equipment can be depreciated on a straight-line basis over a five-year life at €100,000 per year. The equipment is expected to be sold for €100,000 in five years.* [@book, p.460]

*Net working capital (NWC) required to support the new product is estimated to be equal to 10 per cent of net sales of the new product. The NWC will be needed at the start of the year. This means that if sales were €1 in year 1, the NWC needed to support this one euro of sales would be committed at the beginning of year 1. The company's discount rate for the unlevered cash flows associated with this new product is 18 per cent, and the tax rate is 37.3 per cent.* [@book, p.460]

*What is the NPV of this project?* [@book, p.460]

### Exercise 13.11

*Compute the NPV of the online air ticket purchasing scheme in Example 13.4, assuming that the debt capacity of the project zero.* [@book, p.460]

### Exercise 13.12

*Use the risk-neutral valuation method to directly show that the risk-neutral discounted value of the existing debt of Glastron is €636,000 higher if the project in Example 13.17 is adopted.* [@book, p.460]

### Exercise 13.13

*Applied Micro Devices (AMD) currently spends £213,333 a year leasing office space in Leeds, UK. Because lease payments are tax deductible at a 28 per cent corporate tax rate, the firm spends about £153,600 per year $\left[= £213,333\left(1-0.28\right)\right]$ on an after-tax basis to lease the building. The firm has no debt, and has an equity beta of 2. Assuming an expected market return of 12 per cent and a risk-free rate of 6 per cent, its CAPM-based cost of capital is 18 per cent. Suppose AMD has the opportunity to buy its office space for £1 million. The office building is a relatively risk-free investment. The firm can finance 100 per cent of the purchase with tax-deductible mortgage payments. The mortgage rate is only slightly higher than the risk-free rate. How does AMD determine whether to buy the building or continue to lease it?* [@book, p.460]

### Exercise 13.14

*SL is currently an all-equity-firm with a beta of equity of 1. The risk-free rate is 6 per cent and the market risk premium is 11 per cent. Assume the CAPM is true, and that there are no taxes. What is the company's WACC? If management levers the company at a debt to equity ratio of 5 to 1, using perpetual riskless debt, what will the WACC become? How would your WACC answer change if the government raised the tax rate from zero to 28 per cent?* [@book, p.460]

### Exercise 13.15

*Akron plc consists of £50 million in perpetual riskless debt and £50 million in equity. The current market value of its assets is £100 million and the beta of its equity return is 1.2. Assume the risk-free rate is 6 per cent, the expected return of the market portfolio is 13 per cent per year, and the CAPM is true. Compute the expected return of Akron's equity and its WACC assuming a 28 per cent corporate tax rate.* [@book, p.460]

### Exercise 13.16

*Akron, from the last example, is considering an exchange offer where half of Akron's outstanding debt (£25 million) is retired. The purchase of this debt would be financed by issuing £25 million in equity to the debt holders of Akron. Assuming debt policy that is consistent with the Hamada model, what will Akron's new WACC be after the exchange offer?* [@book, p.460]
